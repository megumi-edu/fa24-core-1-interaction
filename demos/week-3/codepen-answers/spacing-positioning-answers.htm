<!-- Answer each of the 22 questions by changing the code! -->

<h3>Divs and Spans</h3>

<!-- Question 1 -->
<p>1. Turn one <span class="color-word">word</span> in this sentence to a color.</p>

<!-- Question 2 -->
<p>2. Make each letter in this word a different color:
    <span class="color-word">M</span><span class="color-orange">a<span><span class="color-yellow">g</span><span class="color-green">i</span><span class="color-blue">c</span>
</p>

<!-- Question 3 -->
<p>3. Highlight the following text by giving it a yellow background: <span class="highlight-me">Highlight me!</span></p>

<!-- Question 4 -->
<p>4. Did your work in question 3 alter the following text? If so, why did it get altered? What's different about it?</p>
<div class="highlight-me">Highlight me!</div>
<i>Yes, this question was also altered because it shares the class "highlight-me". It appears different because this is a div, which is a block element.</i>

<h3>Display Properties</h3>

<!-- Question 5 -->
<p>5. Make these divs appear side-by-side by adding one line in css. Why is there space between them?</p>

<div class="side-by-side"></div>
<div class="side-by-side"></div>
<div class="side-by-side"></div>
<div class="side-by-side"></div>

<i>There is space between each element because each one has a margin of 10px.</i>

<!-- Question 6 -->
<p>6. Make this div disappear. Don't delete any HTML, though!</p>
<div class="gone">Poof! I'm gone.</div>

<h3>Margins and Padding</h3>

<!-- Question 7 -->
<p>7. Increase the amount of orange all around in this div by adding one line of css.</p>

<div class="increase-orange">Hello World</div>

<!-- Question 8 -->
<p>8. Separate these divs so they don't look like one big block.</p>

<div class="separate-me"></div>
<div class="separate-me"></div>
<div class="separate-me"></div>
<div class="separate-me"></div>

<!-- Question 9 -->
<p>9. Make these buttons more user-friendly by giving them some shape and space.</p>

<a href="#" class="user-friendly">Link 1</a>
<a href="#" class="user-friendly">Another Link</a>
<a href="#" class="user-friendly">Third Link</a>

<!-- Question 10 -->
<p>10. Add one line of css to vertically center the text inside the square. (Hint: think about line height)</p>

<div class="static" href="#">
    <span class="center-me">Center me</span>
</div>

<h3>Positioning</h3>

<!-- Question 11 -->
<p>11. Move this div 50px to the left and 50px upward.</p>
<div class="left-upward"></div>

<!-- Question 12 -->
<p>12. Add three lines of CSS to have this div 10px from the top of the window, and 10px from the right so that it stays there even if you scroll.</p>

<a href="#">
    <div class="fixed-btn">Fixed button</div>
</a>

<!-- Question 13 -->
<p>13. Set the "top" property of this div to "20px" and the "left" property to "40px" Did it change? Why or why not?</p>

<div class="position-20-40"></div>
<i>It did not change because this element has a default position of "static". You need to change this to something like relative or absolute for it to move.</i>

<!-- Question 14 -->
<p>14. Move the blue div 30px to the right and 30 pixels upward, without moving the other divs from their current positions.
<p>

<div class="dont-move"></div>
<div class="dont-move"></div>
<div class="move-me"></div>
<div class="dont-move"></div>

<!-- Question 15 -->
<p>15 For the question above, set the display of all of those elements to "inline-block". How does the blue div behave?</p>
<i>The blue div moves inline along with everything else, but it is offset by 30px to the right and 30px upward.</i>

<!-- Question 16 -->
<p>16. Position the smaller square so that it is both horizontally and vertically centered over the larger square. Only use position, and the top/left/right/bottom properties.</p>

<div class="larger-div"></div>
<div class="smaller-div"></div>

<!-- Question 17 -->
<p>
    a. Change one property in the CSS to move the blue (child) div to the bottom left corner of the gray (parent) div. <i>Change right to left: 0;</i>
    <br>b. Do it again, but move it to the top right corner. <i>Change bottom: to top:, and left: to right:</i>
    <br>c. Using only top/left/bottom/right, can you center the blue div inside the grey div?
</p>

<div class="parent-div">
    <div class="child-div"></div>
</div>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Db2WkJh/Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-10-42-33-PM.png" class="img-ref">

<div class="replicate-me">
    <div class="red-square"></div>
    <div class="pink-square"></div>
    <div class="yellow-square"></div>
    <div class="green-square"></div>
    <div class="blue-square"></div>
</div>

<!-- Question 21 -->
<p>21. In the example above, what was the "position" for the grey box? What was the position for the colored squares? What happens if you take out "position:relative" from the grey box?</p>
<i>The grey box is position relative. Each colored square is position absolute. If you take out position relative, the squares jump to the top of the page, since the body element is now the nearest relatively positioned ancestor.</i>
