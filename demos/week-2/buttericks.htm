      <div class="main">
        <p>If you work with <span class="special">information and ideas</span>, then writing plays a central role in your professional life.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You might be a programmer, writing software documentation.</li>
          <li>You might be a scientist, writing a grant proposal.</li>
          <li>You might be a lawyer, writing a brief for court.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When we think of “professional writers,” we probably think of novelists, screenwriters, or journalists. But the programmer, the scientist, the lawyer—and you, if your work depends on presenting written ideas—all deserve to be called professional writers.</p>
        <p>But as professional writers, we do more than write. We edit, we format, we print, we generate PDFs, we make web pages. More than ever, we’re responsible for delivering the written word to our readers. So we’re not just writers—we’re publishers.</p>
        <p>Typography is the visual component of the written word. Thus, being a publisher of the written word necessarily means being a typographer.</p>
        <p>This book will make you a better typographer.</p>
        <p>I’m not here to tell you that typography is more important than the substance of your writing. It’s not.</p>
        <p>But typography can enhance your writing. Typography can create a better first impression. Typography can reinforce your key points. Typography can extend reader attention. When you ignore typography, you’re ignoring an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of your writing.</p>
        <p>And isn’t that why you write at all? To have an effect on readers? To move them, to persuade them, to spur them to action?</p>
        <p>If so, then you should want what typography has to offer. Best of all, it’s fast and it’s easy. Unlike, say, learning to be a better writer. (Skeptical? Have a look at <a href="typography-in-ten-minutes.html">typography in ten minutes</a>.)</p>
        <h2>How this book is organized</h2>
        <p>This book is based on three core principles:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Good typography is part of good writing.</li>
          <li>As a professional writer, you should hold your documents to the same standards as professionally published material. Why? Because your documents <em>are</em> professionally published material. Moreover, there’s no technical barrier to achieving the same results.</li>
          <li>Any writer can master the essentials of good typography.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Still, what many writers consider good typography is an accumulation of bad habits and urban legends. This book will help you set these aside in favor of professional typographic practices.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first chapter of this book, <a href="why-typography-matters.html">why typography matters</a>, explains what typography is and why you should care.</li>
          <li>The next two chapters cover typographic rules. <a href="type-composition.html">Type composition</a> covers the symbols and characters available on the keyboard. <a href="text-formatting.html">Text formatting</a> covers the appearance of characters and text.</li>
          <li>Next, <a href="font-recommendations.html">font recommendations</a> introduces you to the secret weapon of the world’s best typographers—professional fonts.</li>
          <li>After these foundational topics, <a href="page-layout.html">Page layout</a> covers the broader issues that surface when putting documents together.</li>
          <li>The last chapter, <a href="sample-documents.html">sample documents</a>, brings everything together by working through before-and-after examples of common document types.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There’s more than one right way to use this book. Some will want to learn everything in <a href="type-composition.html">type composition</a> before moving on to <a href="text-formatting.html">text formatting</a>. Others will want to master the simpler, early rules in each chapter before trying the later, more advanced rules. Others will want to refer to the book only when a specific typographic question arises.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the path you choose, don’t just read the rules. Practice. Find typographic problems and solve them. That’s the easiest way to get better at typography.</p>
        <p>The typographic rules in this book aren’t limited to particular software. You can apply them in any modern page-layout program, word processor, or web browser.</p>
        <p>I’ve included specific tips for Microsoft Word 2010, 2013, and 2016 (for Windows); Microsoft Word 2016 (for Mac OS); Apple Pages 7 (for Mac OS); and HTML/CSS. Tips for Word apply to all versions unless specified.</p>
        <p>But the focus of this book is typography. It’s not intended to replace your software manual or other technical resources. I’ve skipped instructions for topics that are especially basic (e.g., how to apply <a href="bold-or-italic.html">bold or italic</a> formatting) or especially complicated (e.g., how to implement <a href="paragraph-and-character-styles.html">paragraph and character styles</a>).</p>
        <p>Written documents lie along a continuum from more typographically flexible (e.g., <a href="letterhead.html">letterhead</a>, <a href="research-papers.html">research papers</a>) to less (e.g., <a href="resumes.html">résumés</a>). Not every recommendation in this book will suit every document. Use your judgment.</p>
        <p>What qualifies me to write about typography? I have a visual-arts degree from Harvard, where I learned traditional letterpress printing and digital font design. After college, I worked as a font designer for the Font Bureau and Matthew Carter. I then started a website-design studio in San Francisco called Atomic Vision, which eventually became part of Red Hat, an open-source technology company. Later, I went to law school at UCLA. Along the way, I’ve written frequently about text, typography, and related topics (including the paperback <a href="http://typo.la/amzn">Typography for Lawyers</a>). I also continue to design fonts, including those used herein—see <a href="mb-fonts.html">MB fonts</a>.</p>
        <p>For over 25 years, typography has been a source of enjoyment for me. I hope that you also find it rewarding, and that it adds satisfaction—and maybe even some fun—to your writing.</p>

                <p class="short-rule">Reinforces the meaning of the text</p>
              </div>
              <p>Good ty­pog­ra­phy <em>re­in­forces the mean­ing of the text</em>.</p>
              <p>Al­most all texts com­mu­ni­cate a set of points <em>(The pe­ti­tion should be de­nied for three rea­sons)</em>. Some­times a text also needs to in­struct the reader <em>(Add lines 7 through 21 and en­ter the to­tal here)</em>. Other texts of­fer warn­ings or ad­mo­ni­tions <em>(You must be 48 inches tall to ride; Speed limit 75)</em>. In every case, good ty­pog­ra­phy sup­ports and re­in­forces the mes­sage. Good ty­pog­ra­phy makes the text more <span class="no-hyphens">effective.</span></p>
              <p>Three sub­sidiary propo­si­tions flow from <span class="no-hyphens">this:</span></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Good ty­pog­ra­phy is mea­sured by how well it re­in­forces the mean­ing of the text, not by some ab­stract scale of merit. Ty­po­graphic choices that work for one text won’t nec­es­sar­ily work for an­other. Corol­lary: good ty­pog­ra­phers don’t rely on rote so­lu­tions. One size never fits <span class="no-hyphens">all.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>For a given text, many ty­po­graphic so­lu­tions would work equally well. Ty­pog­ra­phy is not an al­ge­bra prob­lem with one cor­rect <span class="no-hyphens">answer.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Your abil­ity to pro­duce good ty­pog­ra­phy de­pends on how well you un­der­stand the goals of your text, not on taste or vi­sual train­ing. Corol­lary: if you mis­un­der­stand the goals of your text, good ty­pog­ra­phy be­comes purely a mat­ter of <span class="no-hyphens">luck.</span></p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Pause to con­sider propo­si­tion #3. Ty­pog­ra­phy is vi­sual, so it’s easy to con­clude that it’s pri­mar­ily an artis­tic or aes­thetic pur­suit. Not so. Ty­pog­ra­phy is pri­mar­ily <span class="no-hyphens">utilitarian.</span></p>
              <p>There­fore, good ty­pog­ra­phy is mea­sured on a util­i­tar­ian yard­stick. Ty­pog­ra­phy that is aes­thet­i­cally pleas­ant, but that doesn’t re­in­force the mean­ing of the text, is a fail­ure. Ty­pog­ra­phy that re­in­forces the mean­ing of the text, even if aes­thet­i­cally un­pleas­ant, is a <span class="no-hyphens">success.</span></p>
              <p>Does that mean that ef­fec­tive ty­pog­ra­phy can be ugly? Sure. Some­times ugly is bet­ter than <span class="no-hyphens">pretty.</span></p>
              <p>Look at the high­way signs <span class="no-hyphens">again.</span></p>
              <p class="image"><img src="images/roadsign-standard.jpg" /></p>
              <p class="image"><img src="images/roadsign-script.jpg" /></p>
              <div class="aside">
                <p>For these rea­sons, high­way-sig­nage fonts have been the sub­ject of rig­or­ous leg­i­bil­ity <span class="no-hyphens">testing.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p>The script font used on the sec­ond sign could be called<span class="dquo-open-push"></span><span class="dquo-open-pull"> “pret­tier”</span> than the stan­dard high­way-sig­nage font. But a high­way sign has a spe­cial pur­pose: it’s meant to be read quickly, from long dis­tances, at odd an­gles, and un­der vari­able light­ing and weather. The high­way-sig­nage font stays leg­i­ble un­der all these con­di­tions. It’s good ty­pog­ra­phy be­cause it sup­ports the sign’s <span class="no-hyphens">message.</span></p>
              <p>The script font may be pret­tier, but in this con­text, it’s bad ty­pog­ra­phy be­cause it’s not suited to the task. Con­versely, the high­way-sig­nage font would look ter­ri­ble on a wed­ding in­vi­ta­tion, where the script font would be <span class="no-hyphens">appropriate.</span></p>
              <p>A re­lated <span class="no-hyphens">example:</span></p>
              <p class="image"><img src="images/speed-limit-75.svg" /></p>
              <p>Here, the same font is used in all three ver­sions of this sign. But the first two signs fail to de­liver the mes­sage—<em>the speed limit is 75</em>—be­cause the ty­pog­ra­phy un­der­mines the text. The most im­por­tant el­e­ment is the num­ber <em>75</em>. Also im­por­tant is the cap­tion <em>speed limit</em>. Only the third ver­sion gets the bal­ance right. It’s the only ex­am­ple of good ty­pog­ra­phy among the <span class="no-hyphens">three.</span></p>
              <p>Use this prin­ci­ple to test the qual­ity of your own ty­po­graphic work. The ad­van­tage of a util­i­tar­ian bench­mark over an aes­thetic one is that it doesn’t re­quire aes­thetic judg­ment. Trust me—if you’re just start­ing out in ty­pog­ra­phy, you’ll pro­duce some ugly work. Don’t worry. If it’s ugly <em>and</em> ef­fec­tive, you’re mak­ing <span class="no-hyphens">progress.</span></p>

                  <li>
                    <p>A pop­u­lar but flawed line of rea­son­ing holds that the best ty­pog­ra­phy is<span class="dquo-open-push"></span><span class="dquo-open-pull"> “in­vis­i­ble”.</span> This idea dates back at least to Beat­rice Warde’s 1932 es­say <a href="http://gmunch.home.pipeline.com/typo-L/misc/ward.htm"><span class="dquo-open-push"></span><span class="dquo-open-pull">“The</span> Crys­tal Gob­let”,</a> and has en­joyed a re­cent vogue among de­sign­ers ea­ger to sound trendy.
